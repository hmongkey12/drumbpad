# drumpad

A digital version of the AKAI Professional MPD218 built using typescript, html, and css. This project is a WIP.

The index.html uses the index.js file, but the logic was written in the index.ts file.
The index.js file was a result of transpiling the index.ts via tsc.

```bash
tsc index.ts
```

I have included the index.js file for ease of use.

####Usage

Add your audio files to the sounds folder. Type it into the input box corresponding to the pad number and click update sounds.
